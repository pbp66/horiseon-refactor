# HTML SEO Refactor

## Project Description

User Story:
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given a generic webpage, when I view the source HTML and CSS, it contains semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. When I view images, all accessible images contain descriptive alt text. When I view the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order. When I view the title element, I find a concise and descriptive title.

This project serves to explore HTML and CSS elements focused on learning about semantic tags, logical flow, and reducing redundancy. I learned a lot about semantic elements and how CSS selectors work together. I did a lot of experimenting to see what I could and could not condense into as few selectors as possible. I researched several articles on alt text so it would be concise and descriptive for each image.
